## üß† Topics Covered

1. **Why Use NumPy**  
   Learn why NumPy is essential for data science and how it outperforms Python lists.

2. **Creating NumPy Arrays**  
   Practice creating arrays from lists, using `arange()`, `linspace()`, and other built-in functions.

3. **Indexing and Slicing**  
   Understand how to access and modify elements using slicing, boolean indexing, and fancy indexing.

4. **Multidimensional Indexing & Axis**  
   Dive into 2D and 3D arrays, and learn how operations vary across different axes.

5. **Data Types in NumPy**  
   Explore data types (`dtype`), type conversions, and memory efficiency.

6. **Broadcasting in NumPy**  
   Learn how NumPy handles arithmetic operations between arrays of different shapes.

7. **Built-in Mathematical Functions**  
   Use powerful mathematical functions like `sum()`, `mean()`, `sqrt()`, `std()`, and more.
